### Grading monolingual cards

As long as you understand the word, you're doing fine. I also like to remember highlighted parts that differentiate words from other similar words (because it helps with my memory) but you can do whatever. I recommend experimenting around and seeing what works for you. If you are continuously doing Anki and immersion you are going to eventually learn things regardless of what you do. For a lot of words, even just recalling the English definition is enough. You can adjust your grading philosophy whenever, don't overthink it.
